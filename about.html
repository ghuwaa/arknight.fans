					<h2>Game Background Information</h2>
					<p>The unexplained and rampant natural disaster swept across the land, resulting in the emergence of a large number of mysterious minerals known as "source rocks". Although the discovery of source stones has a long history, relying on technological progress, the energy contained in them has enabled civilization to smoothly enter modernization. However, at the same time, source stones themselves have also given rise to the existence of "infected individuals".
Having both physical strength and misfortune, some of them now attempt to integrate with the source stone and bring a new order to the earth. This war conspiracy is a new obstacle we have encountered in our fight against natural disasters.
As a member of Rhode Island, you will work with the public leader of Rhode Island, Amia, to hire personnel to frequently enter high-risk areas affected by natural disasters, assist victims, handle mineral disputes, and fight against integration movements——
Are you ready for the tactical mind of Rhode Island?</p>

					<h2>Game Mode</h2>
					<p>Before the battle begins, players should form a reasonable formation of their agents and choose appropriate skills.
After the battle begins, players need to deploy agents to defend according to the enemy's attack direction, and at the same time, if costs allow, choose corresponding professions of agents to join the battle based on the monster type. After the enemy is completely cleared, if the player's defense value is not 0, the battle is won; If the player's defense value is full, they can receive a 3-star rating and additional rewards.
Some levels have additional raid modes. In the raid mode, the attack power of enemy units will be increased to a certain extent, and there will be some level additional conditions (such as slowing down the natural cost recovery speed, etc.). The raid mode only has 1 defense point, and the rationality consumed by a failed battle will also be doubled. After completing the raid mode of the level, you can receive a 4-star rating, as well as rewards such as dragon gate coins and experience.</p>
